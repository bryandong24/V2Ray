# V2Ray

## The filed named `v2ray.json` is the configuration file. Upload that to whatever client you are using as your config profile. 


### If you are using an iOS device you can use [this vRay client](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/v2box-v2ray-client/id6446814690). There are some ads but it's fine. This app works on MacOS too. If you are on Windows you can use any of the ones on this site: https://www.v2ray.com/en/awesome/tools.html.
